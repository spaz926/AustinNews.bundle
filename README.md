AustinNews.bundle
=================

Plex Media Center Plugin offering Austin news channels for live streaming.

Two Austin channels are offered. This includes:

* KXAN Channel 36 (NBC)
* KTBC Channel 7 (FOX)

This is a fork of jgenender's DenverNews plugin modified for Austin news channels.

The plugin uses the MP4/IOS M3U8 streams and hence works great on those devices as well as the Safari web browser. Other web browsers do not appear to work very well at this time since they do not appear to support the HLS streaming (Google this issue on the Plex forums for more info). It also works well with the Apple TV using PlexConnect, Plex desktop client, Roku, and XBMC. It may work on other clients, but I have not tried. Also, at this stage, the plugin reads the M3U8 and pulls the one with the highest bitrate. It would be nice to have code that can dynamically select it based upon your bandwidth or other algorithm.

Enjoy!
